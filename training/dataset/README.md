# Dataset 

The dataset must be structured in the following form:

```shell
dataset/
    1/
        img_1.jpg
        img_2.jpg
        ...
        img_999.jpg
    2/
        img_1.jpg
        ...
    999/
        ...
```
Each class of images must have its own directory containing all the images to train and test the network.
